This project is archived. It was designed for use with a registration system we no longer use. Useful features have been ported to our new system, and we no longer needed to use a Chrome extension to work around feature gaps.



This little extension provides a way to quickly and easily scan IDs and print con-goer badges.

**Note!** this is only for FC (1311) and only works for the year 2022 (372652).
